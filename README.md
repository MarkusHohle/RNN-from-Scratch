# RNN-from-Scratch
 Lecture material (codes, pdf). RNN with numpy only

 Step-by-step description to build, test and run an RNN ("many to many"). 

## chapters
 1) building and testing a RNN cell

 2) Backpropagation through time (BPTT)	

 3) full backpropagation

 4) building an optimizer (see chapter in "CNN-from-Scratch" for more details) with learning rate decay and momentum

 5) testing the RNN and adding training & application to package
